# Perlin Noise Generator

This Java program generates Perlin noise, a type of gradient noise used in computer graphics and procedural content generation.

## Overview

The Perlin Noise algorithm creates smooth, natural-looking random patterns. It's commonly used for terrain generation, texture synthesis, and other visual effects.

## Usage

1. **Adjust Parameters:**
   * `seed`: Set the random seed for consistent noise patterns.
   * `octaves`: Control the number of octaves (layers) in the noise.
   * `persistence`: Adjust the persistence (amplitude decay) between octaves.

2. **Interpret the Output:**
The program generates Perlin noise values for specified (x, y) coordinates. You can use these values for various purposes, such as terrain heightmaps or procedural textures.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of an output
